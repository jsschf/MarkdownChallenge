# About Me
[Back to Home](README.md)

I'm from the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. I lived there up until I graduated from Camdenton High School in 2013. After graduation, I joined the Army as a Cavalry Scout. I got out of the Army in April of 2017, and then started my IT degree at Mizzou the following August. I'm currently a senior at Mizzou and plan on getting a web development job after graduating.
